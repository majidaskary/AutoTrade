# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to AutoTrade Core.

Since this repository represents a **public overview** of a private project, contributions should focus on:

- Improving documentation  
- Suggesting architectural enhancements  
- Proposing new conceptual strategy categories  
- Identifying design inconsistencies or improvements  

Direct code contributions are not accepted here.

Before submitting changes:

1. Open an issue describing your suggestion.  
2. Reference existing documents when possible.  
3. Provide clear and concise reasoning.

Pull Requests should update documentation without revealing proprietary implementation details.
